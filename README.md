# Line-Length-Detector-System

Built a system that can take data from a line at a restaurant, using IR sensors, analyze this data, 
and provide feedback to users. The detection tool has three components: sensing technology, data processing unit, and an 
interface.

The data processing unit will determine the approximate wait time and the percent full in line.
